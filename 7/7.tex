\begin{problem}{2}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}{}
    Since both sequences converge uniformly (to $f$ and $g$), fix $\epsilon$ such that
    $$|f_n(x)-f(x)| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$$ 
    for all $x$ when $n > N$ and 
    $$|g_m(x)-g(x)| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$$
    for all $x$ when $m>M$. Let $T=max(N,M)$. Then if $n > T$,
    $$|f_n(x)+g_n(x) - f(x)-g(x)| = |f_n(x)-f(x)+g_n(x)-g(x)|$$
    $$\le  |f_n(x)-f(x)|+|g_n(x)-g(x)| = \epsilon$$
    Next assume that both sequences are of bounded functions. From problem 1, we can conclude that both
    sequences are uniformly bounded, that is there exists $T$ such that
    $$|f_i(x)| < T$$
    for all $x$ and $i$ and there exists $P$ such that
    $$|g_i(x)| < P$$
    for all $x$ and $i$. Then let $M=max(T,P)$. Then
    $$|f_n(x)g_n(x)-f(x)g(x)| = |f_n(x)g_n(x)-f(x)g_n(x)+f(x)g_n(x)-f(x)g(x)|$$
    $$=|g_n(x)(f_n(x)-f(x))+f(x)(g_n(x)-g(x))| \le |M(f_n(x)-f(x))+M(g_n(x)-g(x))|$$
    $$\le M|(f_n(x)-f(x))|+M|(g_n(x)-g(x))|$$
    and since the sequences are uniformly continuous, for all $\epsilon > 0$
    $$< M\epsilon+M\epsilon = 2M\epsilon$$
    thus $\{f_ng_n\}$ is uniformly convergent.
    \qed
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}{3}
    Construct sequences $\{f_n\}$, $\{g_n\}$ which converge uniformly on some set $E$, but such that $\{f_ng_n\}$ does 
    not converge uniformly on $E$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}{}
    $f_n(x)=x$ for all $x$ converges to $f(x)=x$ uniformly with $\epsilon=0$ for all $n$. 
    $g_n(x)=\frac{1}{n}$ for all $x$ is the same. So $f_n(x)g_n(x)=0$. But then for any $n$, there exists 
    an $x$ equal to it, thus for all $n$ there exists some $x$ such that $f_n(x)g_n(x)=\frac{x}{n}=1 > \epsilon$.
    \qed
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}{4}
    Consider
    $$f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1+n^2x}$$
    For what values of $x$ does the series converge absolutely? On what intervals does it converge uniformly?
    On what intervals does it fail to converge uniformly? Is $f$ continuous wherever the series converges?
    Is $f$ bounded?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}{}
    The series is almost convergent (comparing with $\frac{1}{n^2}$), except for a few points. When $x=0$ 
    we get $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}1$ which diverges. There are countable number of points where a term is 
    undefined, namely $-\frac{1}{n^2}$ making the denominator 0.\\
    For any $x>0$ it converges uniformly since given some $\epsilon>0$, $\frac{1}{1+n^2x} \le \frac{1}{n^2\epsilon}$ and the right
    hand side converges uniformly. The same is true for $x<0$ except for the aformentioned countable points.\\
    Any interval containing 0 on the boundary does not converge uniformly. We can always pick an $x$ so that the partial sums never
    converge.\\
    $f$ does not converge at $x=0$ so it's not bounded.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}{5}
    Let
    \begin{equation}
        f_n(x)=
        \begin{cases}
            0, & \bigg (x < \frac{1}{n+1} \bigg ) \\
            \sin^2\frac{\pi}{x}, & \bigg (\frac{1}{n+1} \le x \le \frac{1}{n} \bigg) \\
            0, &  \bigg(\frac{1}{n} < x \bigg) \\
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    Show that $\{f_n\}$ converges to a continuous function, but not uniformly. Use the series $\sum f_n$ to
    show that the absolute convergence, even for all $x$, does not imply uniform convergence.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}{}
    The function converges (point-wise at least) to $f=0$, since rationals are dense in reals, fixing any $x$
    there is always an $n$ such that $f_n(x)=0$.\\
    The series cannot converge uniformly because for any $n$, there exists some $m$ such that 
    $x=\frac{1}{2m+\frac{1}{2}}$ such that $\frac{1}{n+1} < x < \frac{1}{n+1}$, thus
    $f(x) = \sin^2(2\pi m+\frac{\pi}{2})=1$.
    \qed
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}{6}
    Prove that the series
    $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n \frac{x^2+n}{n^2}$$
    converges uniformly in every bounded interval, but does not converge absolutely for any value of $x$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}{}
    Skip for now.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}{7}
    For $n=1,2,3,...$, $x$ real, put
    $$f_n(x)=\frac{x}{1+nx^2}$$
    Show that $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly to a function $f$, and that the equation
    $$f'(x)=\lim_{n \to \infty} f'_n(x)$$
    is correct if $x \ne 0$, but false if $x=0$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}{}
    Using the quotient rule and differentiating $f_n$ and setting it equal to $0$ shows that $f_n$ has
    its max at $x=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, at which $f_n(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}$. Thus the sequence $f_n$
    is bounded by $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}$ which converges uniformly to $f=0$. \\
    Since 
    $$f'_n(x)=\frac{1-nx^2}{(1+nx^2)^2}$$
    so
    $$f'_n(0)=1$$
    so $\lim_{n\to \infty}f'_n(x)=1$ but since $f=0$, $f'=0$.
    \qed
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}{8}
    If 
    \begin{equation}
        I(x)=
        \begin{cases}
            0, & \big (x \le 0 \big) \\
            1, &  \big(x > 0 \big) \\
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    if $\{x_n\}$ is a sequence of distinct points of $(a,b)$, and if $\sum |c_n|$ converges, prove that 
    the series
    $$f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n I(x-x_n) \qquad (a \le x \le b)$$
    converges uniformly, and that $f$ is continuous for every $x \ne x_n$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}{}
    Since $I$ is just an indicator function, it follows that
    $$f_N(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} c_n I(x-x_n) \le \sum_{n=1}^{N} |c_n|$$. Since $\sum |c_n|$ converges absolutely,
    it follows that $f_n$ converges uniformly. \\
    $f$ will be continuous if each $f_n$ is. And each $f_n$ is continuous if $x \ne x_n$, since if it 
    "jumps" via the indicator function and misses or includes an extra term greater than some $\epsilon$ 
    in the summation if so.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}{9}
    Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of continuous functions which converges uniformly to a function $f$ on a 
    set $E$. Prove that 
    $$\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x_n)=f(x)$$
    for every sequence of points $x_n\in E$ such that $x_n \to x$, and $x \in E$. Is the converse of this true?
